🦖 Dino Network Website — Development Instructions
Project Overview
Build a fully functional website for Dino Network.
This is not just a landing page — it must be a complete website with working forms, animations, video integration, and responsive design.
Primary goal: Convert visitors into creator applications.
All features must work 100% (forms must submit properly and send to email).
________________


TAB 1: HOME
Navigation & Call-to-Action
* The primary top-right navigation button must display: Join Now
* This button must redirect users to the Creator Application form.
* Remove the “Watch Demo” button entirely.
* The mid-page primary CTA button must display: Join the Dino Family
* This button must also redirect to the Creator Application form.
________________


Scroll Animations
* Implement smooth scrolling across the entire page.
* Add scroll-triggered animations for sections as users move down the page (fade-in or slide-in effects).
* Animations must feel modern and smooth, not excessive.
________________


Video Placement
* Add a video section explaining what a TikTok LIVE agency is.
* This video must be placed before the “Why Creators Choose Dino Network” section.
* I will provide the video file.

Section: Why Creators Choose Dino Network
Title:
Why Creators Choose Dino Network
Content:
Dino Network was built by a streamer who understands the creator's journey firsthand. Having streamed myself, I know the challenges, pressure, and dedication it takes to grow on TikTok LIVE.
I’ve seen too many creators join random agencies only to experience slow responses, lack of support, and poor guidance when they needed help the most. That’s exactly why Dino Network was created — to be a creator-first network that actually cares.
We focus on account protection, real engagement, and proven LIVE growth systems, all with the same shared goal: helping creators grow safely, earn consistently, and build something long-term — together.

Hey guys! My name is Hunter, my TikTok is @hunt2active. I stream Fortnite and I am a fairly new streamer to TikTok and have been on my journey since July. I've been a member of Dino Network for 2 months now and I have nothing but positive feedback since being a member of the best agency on the app. Dino has helped me with more than just TikTok questions, a genuine agency and person that will talk to you about anything and everything and is nothing but supportive. Dino offers so much more than anyone could ask for and joining was the best decision I've made since clicking that go live button! The community we have and the people I've met through this is incredible! I would highly recommend Dino Network to anyone new to the app or looking for an agency! DINO ON TOP

Hey guys! My name is Jonathan and my TikTok is @jona_breton. I do Banter Battles on TikTok and sometimes stream games on here, still fairly new to my streaming journey. I've been with Dino Network for a little over a month now and honestly have nothing but positive feedback. The community Dino has built is something special, any questions or concerns I've ever had, Dino has been there to answer. We get 1 on 1 support when we need it, a whole discord so we can communicate with others in the agency and so much more! I would 100 percent recommend Dino Network to anyone who's new to streaming and wants to join an amazing community! You won't regret it!

* Yurrr wsg guys, this is Billy (@billyswilly_). l joined Dino Network because they're U.S.based and I saw other real creators already in the family, so I knew it was legit. After joining, I realized they're trustworthy and really focused on helping you grow. I don't regret it one bit. The community is super supportive. They give 1-on-1 help, assist with getting a stream key, and have a Discord full of guides and resources. Dino has helped me a lot, and this agency honestly stands out. From quick personal support to and even picking creators for TikTok events—no one else is doing that. It's more than an agency, it's a community. I love Dino Network and will be with them till the end. I have no regrets and 100% recommend them! Big shoutout to DINO NETWORK!
